TASK:

In this Project i implemented a URL shortener service. This service enables registering a
“long URL”. e.g. www.somethingverylong.com/1234.html and receiving a “short URL” that will
redirect to it. e.g. localhost/sh54.

This service is similar to the service offered by https://tinyurl.com/.


Front-end:
The front-end is a web page displaying a simple web form:

After entering a “long URL” and pressing the “Create short URL” button, the web page will
present the generated “short URL”.

The front-end  implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Backend:

The backend is a webserver. For this coding task, the backend should run on the localhost.

a. When browsing to http://localhost/, the backend will service the front-end’s main page, 
     containing the web form asking to "Enter a long URL" (see above front-end mockup).

b. When pressing "Create short URL", the front-end will contact the backend and send the form arguments. 
    The backend will generate a "short URL", store it in a database and return the "short URL" to the front-end 
    to be displayed to the user (see above front-end mockup).

c. When accessing a "short URL", for example: http://localhost/sh54, it will be redirected to the appropriate "long URL",
    for example: www.somethingverylong.com/1234.html.

The backend implemented using:

- Python3- the programming language.

- Flask - Web Framework.

- SQLite - Database; note that SQLite is natively supported in python.
